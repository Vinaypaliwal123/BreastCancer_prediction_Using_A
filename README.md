# Breast Cancer Prediction using Neural Networks

Hello, I'm Vinay Paliwal. This project uses a neural network model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on various features of the tumor.

## Code Explanation

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```
These are the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`), visualization (`matplotlib.pyplot`), machine learning (`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`), and deep learning (`tensorflow`).

```python
# Loading the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('breast.csv')
```
This line loads a dataset named 'breast.csv' into a pandas DataFrame.

```python
# Data Preprocessing
dataset['target'] = dataset.diagnosis # Renaming 'diagnosis' column to 'target'
dataset = dataset.drop(columns='diagnosis',axis=1) # Dropping 'diagnosis' column
dataset = dataset.drop(columns='id',axis=1) # Dropping 'id' column
dataset['target'] = dataset['target'].replace(['B','M'],[1,0]) # Converting 'target' column from categorical to numerical
```
These lines rename the 'diagnosis' column to 'target', drop the 'id' column as it's not needed for the prediction, and convert the 'target' column from categorical ('B' for benign and 'M' for malignant) to numerical values (1 for benign and 0 for malignant).

```python
# Splitting the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y)
X = dataset.drop(columns='target',axis=1)
Y = dataset['target']
```
These lines split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y).

```python
# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train,X_test,Y_train,Y_test = train_test_split(X,Y,test_size=0.2,random_state=2)
```
These lines further split the features and target variable into training and testing sets.

```python
# Standardizing the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_std = scaler.fit_transform(X_train.values)
X_test_std = scaler.fit_transform(X_test.values)
```
These lines standardize the features using the StandardScaler from sklearn. This ensures that all the features are on the same scale.

```python
# Building the Neural Network Model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(30,)), # Input layer
    keras.layers.Dense(20,activation='relu'), # Hidden layer
    keras.layers.Dense(40,activation='relu'), # Hidden layer
    keras.layers.Dense(20,activation='relu'), # Hidden layer
    keras.layers.Dense(2,activation='sigmoid'), # Output layer
])
```
These lines build a sequential model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model consists of an input layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer. The 'relu' activation function is used for the hidden layers and the 'sigmoid' activation function is used for the output layer.

```python
# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics = ['accuracy'])
```
These lines compile the model with the 'adam' optimizer, 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' loss function, and accuracy as the metric.

```python
# Training the model
history = model.fit(X_train,Y_train,validation_split=0.1,epochs=10)
```
This line trains the model using the training data. The model's performance is evaluated at each epoch on a validation set, which is 10% of the training data.

```python
# Training the model on standardized data
history2 = model.fit(X_train_std,Y_train,validation_split=0.1,epochs=10)
```
This line trains the model on the standardized training data.

```python
# Evaluating the model's performance
loss , accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_std,Y_test)
```
This line evaluates the model's performance on the standardized testing data.

```python
# Making predictions
input_data =(11.42,20.38,77.58,386.1,0.1425,0.2839,0.2414,0.1052,0.2597,0.09744,0.4956,1.156,3.445,27.23,0.00911,0.07458,0.05661,0.01867,0.05963,0.009208,14.91,26.5,98.87,567.7,0.2098,0.8663,0.6869,0.2575,0.6638,0.173)
input_data = np.array(input_data) # Changing the input to numpy array
input_data = input_data.reshape(1,-1) # Reshaping the array as we are predicting for one data point
input_data = scaler.transform(input_data) # Standardizing the data
prediction = model.predict(input_data) # Making prediction
prediction_label = (np.argmax(prediction)) # Getting the predicted label
```
These lines are used to make predictions on new data. The input data is reshaped and standardized before being passed to the model. The output is the predicted label for the input data, either 'Malignant' or 'Benign'.

## Usage

To use this code, you need to have Python installed along with the libraries mentioned in the code. You also need to have the 'breast.csv' dataset in the same directory as the script.
